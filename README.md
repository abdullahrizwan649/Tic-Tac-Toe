HELLO THERE!

This is my attempt at TIC-TAC-TOE in Android Studio.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________

THE BORING STUFF :/

The application is made using JAVA .

The Minimum SDK is API 21: Android 5.0 (Lollipop). It will run on 98.8% of android devices.

Made while working at KALSOFT :)
